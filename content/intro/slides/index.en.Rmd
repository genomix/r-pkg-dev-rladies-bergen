# Become an R Package Developer!

:wave: Hei!

---

## I've never been in Bergen

:sob:

But... I've been to Norway two times when I was an intern in Gothenburg, Sweden!

## Why develop an R package?

Easiest way to share code/data/R Markdown templates... with

* (future) you,

* the collaborators you know,

* and the collaborators you don't.

---

## Why learning about package development?

[Jon Calder](https://joncalder.co.za/)'s very good wording

* To share code (and data)

* To leverage existing tooling

* To contribute to other packages

---

## Who can write a package? YOU!

Susan Johnston's [wise words](https://github.com/susjoh/fibonacci).

* Can you open R or RStudio?

* Can you install a package?

* Have you ever written a function in R?

* Could you _learn_ how to write a function in R?

* **You can write a package in R**

## What is a package?

>  Pour réduire ses craintes, il faut se dire que ce n’est ni plus ni moins qu’un dossier organisé d’une manière contrainte.

> To be less afraid you have to tell yourself that it's simply a folder organized in a constrained way.

## Automation!

```

## Automating... How?

Remember Clippy?

---

## Automating... How?

Get to know an actually useful Clippy, `{usethis}`!

---

## Website tour

:link: https://tiny.cc/r-pkg

Slides, notes from the demo, further resources, comments!

---

## Time for a demo :rocket:

Notes on the [course website](/intro/demo)

Also refer to the [Whole game chapter of the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html)

---


## Back from the demo

* `devtools::load_all()` (and then install)

* `{usethis}` for all the things.

---

## R CMD check (devtools::check())

```

---

## So what's really hard?

* Writing good code

* Writing a good interface

* Writing good docs

---

## More with packages

* `usethis::use_rmarkdown_template()`

* distributing data `usethis::use_data()`

* packaging a Shiny app (look for examples, and [golemverse](https://golemverse.org/))

* Reproducible analyses, [research compendium](https://annakrystalli.me/rrresearch/10_compendium.html)

---

## Less with packages

* If developing a package for wider distribution, check it does not exist yet. 

* Miles McBain's post ["Project as an R package: An okay idea"](https://milesmcbain.xyz/posts/an-okay-idea/)
